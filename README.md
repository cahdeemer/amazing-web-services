# Amazing Web Services
## A PromptWorks mock app

We are building a (fictional) new cloud infrastructure service and calling it Amazing Web Services. With it, users can provision virtual machines to use as web servers.

Think Digital Ocean, except slower.

The back-end has already been implemented and your job is to build (part of) a user interface that allows users to understand our offerings and spin up new servers with ease.

## Start building...

You must have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed on your computer.

Clone this repository:
`git clone git@github.com:promptworks/amazing-web-services.git`

Install dependencies:
`yarn install`

Compile and run the app using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/):
